Editing the XML file and presets
===============================================================================
In the source directory of the mod ( \Steam\SteamApps\workshop\content\255710\654707599 ), there are three extra xml files besides from the mod defaults which I have created.

[b]WG_GameDefaults[/b]
[url=https://github.com/WhitefangGreytail/WG_CitizenEdit/blob/master/XML_Files/WG_GameDefaults.xml]The game defaults [/url] file is the best transformation of the vanilla game's values.


[b]WG_CarHeavy[/b]
[url=https://github.com/WhitefangGreytail/WG_CitizenEdit/blob/master/XML_Files/WG_CarHeavy.xml]This[/url] is based off mod default values, but sets so that more cars are used to travel.

[b]WG_CarAsWealth[/b]
[url=https://github.com/WhitefangGreytail/WG_CitizenEdit/blob/master/XML_Files/WG_CarAsWealth.xml]This[/url] is based off mod default values, but strongly correlates car use with wealth.


[b]How to use the presets for the mod to use[/b]
Copy the file across into the app_data locaiton and rename the file WG_CitizenEdit.xml 

The directory locations are reiterated below
Windows = C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines
Mac = /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines
Linux = /home/<username>/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines


[b]How to edit the XML?[/b]
Open it up using your favourite text editor.
Guidance for what the values will do are in the following posts.
===============================================================================
[b]Travel[/b]

The modifiers are for [i]car[/i], [i]taxi[/i], [i]bike[/i] (or bicycle) and are used for each age group, wealth and residential density.

The game will do a probability check against each of the modes of car (or motorbike), bicycle and taxi to determine if either of those three modes will be used to travel. There is a fourth option which should be walking or public transport and is the default case if the first three are not taken.
The numbers along the row do not need to add to 100.

================================================================================
[b]Migrate[/b]

Nothing here yet

================================================================================
[b]Lifespan[/b]

[i]modifier[/i]
- Changing this will expand the lifespan of the people by this number. Integer values are accepted. Default is 3

[i]survival[/i]
- Each decile (10th stage) of life will have it's own survival chance. It is defined as the percentage of the decile that will survive to the next decile. Float values with no more than 3 decimal places are preferred


[i]sickness[/i]
- Each decile (10th stage) of life will have it's own sickness chance. It is defined as the percentage of the decile that will become sick by the next decile. Float values with no more than 3 decimal places are preferred
